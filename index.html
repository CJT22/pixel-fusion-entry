                <h3>Super Mario Bros.</h3>
                <p>Super Mario Bros., released in 1985 for the NES, is a platformer where Mario must save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser. Created by Shigeru Miyamoto, it revolutionized video gaming with its smooth controls and introduced the concept of side-scrolling platformers. This is one of the games that saved the video game market after it crashed in 1983.</p>

                <h3>Mario</h3>
                <p>Of course, it wouldn't be Super Mario Bros. without the main man himself. Mario is the plumber who regularly embarks on adventures to save the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser, using power-ups like the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star.</p>

        <h2>The Top 5 Characters of the Retro Gaming World</h2>
        <h3>In my opinion...</h3>

            <div class="top-text">
                <h3>1. Mario</h3>
                <p>Mr. Video Game himself, one of the characters Nintendo made that saved the video game market after its crash in 1983. It is no surprise he ranks number 1 in this list. From Donkey Kong, to Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Mario has made quite a name for himself for being such an iconic video game character, having a lot of fun games in both his mainline series (Super Mario Bros.) and spin-off titles (Mario Kart, Mario Party, Mario & Luigi, and many more). Additionally, with the recent release of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, Mario's popularity is at an all-time high, and I have no doubt that more and more people will get to know this Italian plumber as time goes on.</p>

                <h3>2. Link</h3>
                <p>The Hero of Hyrule, and I know what you're thinking... no, his name is not Zelda! This valiant swordsman's name is Link, the one who saves Princess Zelda from the evil Ganondorf. Link's adventures spearheaded the era of action-adventure games, offering various challenges ranging from combat-related enemy encounters that hone your reaction time and decision-making skills, to tricky, dungeon puzzles that test your problem-solving expertise. Playing as Link and exploring the Kingdom of Hyrule really makes you feel like a courageous warrior, going on an adventure trying to save a damsel in distress. With more game releases and a movie in the works, Link deserves the second spot in this list.</p>

                <h3>3. Kirby</h3>
                <p>Don't let this cute, pink puffball's looks fool you. He can devour enemies easily just by inhaling them, and you know what's the real kicker? He absorbs the enemies' abilities and use those powers against them! On paper, that sounds like a really terrifying power to have, but thanks to the designers responsible for this little ball of terror, they were able to create him as the adorable character we all know and love today. Much like Mario, Kirby's mainline series revolves around platforming, going through numerous obstacles and challenges in order to protect his home, Planet Popstar from all sorts of threats. And with that, Kirby is ranked third in this list.</p>

            <div class="top-text">
                <h3>4. Red</h3>
                <p>The first ever Pokémon trainer to become the very best, like no one ever was. Red opened the gateway for players to experience what it is like to catch, befriend, and train Pokémon that inhabit the region of Kanto. Exploring with your pocket monsters, battling gym leaders, and becoming a Pokémon Master is what makes Pokémon so special to many. As of now, there are already nine generations of Pokémon games. The series is THAT beloved by many fans all across the globe. Red deserves a spot of fourth in this list because we shouldn't forget how the game he starred in, Pokémon Red and Blue, started it all.</p>

                <h3>5. Captain Falcon</h3>
                <p>One who knows how to SHOW US HIS MOVES, Captain Falcon is a relentess bounty hunter/racer who pilots the Blue Falcon in the F-Zero Grand Prix, a racing tournament mainly set on a futuristic version of Earth in the 26th century. His mainline series is not as popular as the rest of the characters' in this list, but he became a staple and a fan favorite thanks to his appearances in the Super Smash Bros. series, a fighting game renowned for its cast of characters coming from all sorts of games. His flamboyant demeanor, flashy moves, and high-octane racing deserves the fifth place in this list.</p>
